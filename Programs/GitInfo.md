## üåø Git Branching Explained
Branches allow you to work on different features, fixes, or experiments independently without affecting the main branch.

### 1. `feature/<name>`
- **Purpose**: For developing new features
- **Example**: `feature/login-page`

### 2. `bugfix/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
- **Purpose**: For fixing non-critical bugs
- **Example**: `bugfix/fix-login-error`

### 3. `hotfix/<name>`
- **Purpose**: For urgent fixes directly to production
- **Example**: `hotfix/crash-on-startup`

### 4. `release/<version>`
- **Purpose**: For preparing a release version
- **Example**: `release/1.2.0`

### 5. `experiment/<name>`
- **Purpose**: For testing ideas or prototypes
- **Example**: `experiment/new-method`
